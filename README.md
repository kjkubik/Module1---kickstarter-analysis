##### Hey Louise, 

##### I have completed analysis of using Kickstarter Campaigns website. 

##### The possibility of your campaign failing is high.

#### Anaylisis Factors leading to this conclusion: 
     - Failed Campaigns: It seems the higher a goal, the more likely it will fail. 
     - At first inspection it seemed goals over $3000 led to a failed campains; however after 
       futher inspection, their were very large goals contributing to failed goals.
     - Successful campaigns goals fell between $1500 and $5000. 
     - Failed campaigns goals fell between $2000 and $10000.
     - Staying below $5049 would be optimal for success.
     - Average Goal of Successful Campaigns: Your goal is double of that average.
	
#### Thanks, 
#### Kim Kubik
